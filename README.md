# Student-Drop-Out-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting student dropout rates using supervised machine learning techniques on government-provided data. By harnessing various algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Perceptron, and KNN, we achieved a commendable accuracy of 92% in predicting dropout occurrences.
