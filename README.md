# Student-Drop-Out-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting student dropout rates using supervised machine learning techniques on government-provided data. By harnessing various algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Perceptron, and KNN, we achieved a commendable accuracy of 92% in predicting dropout occurrences.

# Key Components:
*Data Gathering* : Details on how the government data was obtained, data sources, and preprocessing steps.<br>
*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* : Exploring and visualizing the dataset to understand patterns, distributions, and correlations among variables.<br>
*Feature Engineering* : Any feature selection, extraction, or transformation applied to enhance model performance.<br>
*Model Building* : Implementation and explanation of various supervised ML models used (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Perceptron, KNN).<br>
*Model Evaluation* : Metrics used to evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc.<br>
*Web Application* : Details and code for the Streamlit-based web application for the dropout prediction.<br>

# How it works:
The web application is designed to facilitate user input within specified ranges.<br>
Upon entering the required information and clicking the 'Predict' button, the application will process the input data using the developed predictive model.<br>
Subsequently, the predicted outcome regarding student dropout will be promptly displayed on the screen for the user.

# Setup and Usage:
*Requirements* : Ensure Python, streamlit, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn and required dependencies are installed.<br>
*Execution* : Run the provided Python scripts to train models and launch the Streamlit webpage.<br>
*Interactivity* : Users can input relevant student data via the webpage to obtain dropout probability predictions.<br>
*Model Comparison* : Explore the effectiveness of various models and their accuracy in predicting student dropout.<br>

# Contribution and Enhancement:
Feel free to fork this repository, experiment with other models or enhancements, and contribute to further improving the accuracy or expanding the features of the prediction model.
